In this project, the edge expansion of hypergraphs is explored.
For that, brute-force solutions as well as an approximation algorithm, which is deducted from [1] are implemented.

An example can be seen by running hypergraph-implementation/evaluation.py

The results are discussed in https://github.com/riegerfr/Bachelor-s-thesis-edge-expansion/blob/master/tum-thesis-latex-master/main.pdf

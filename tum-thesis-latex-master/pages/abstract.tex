The problem of finding set with low (edge) expansion on a graph can also be defined on hypergraphs. The expansion is the quotient of the summed weight of the edges crossing $S$ and $V\setminus S$ and the summed weight of all the edges in $S$.
In this thesis a brute force approach as well as an approximation algorithm for obtaining small sets with a low expansion are discussed, implemented and evaluated on different random hypergraphs. For the creation of the hypergraphs different algorithms are presented.

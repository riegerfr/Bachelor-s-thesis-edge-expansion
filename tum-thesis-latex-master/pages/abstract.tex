The problem of finding sets with low edge expansion on a graph can also be defined on hypergraphs. %The expansion is the quotient of the summed weight of the edges crossing $S$ and $V\setminus S$ and the summed weight of all the vertices in $S$.
In this thesis, a brute force approach as well as an approximation algorithm for obtaining small sets with a low expansion are discussed, implemented and the results are evaluated on random hypergraphs. For the creation of the hypergraphs, different algorithms are presented. Especially the approximation algorithm can be useful for finding a set of friends in a social network, which is represented by a hypergraph.
